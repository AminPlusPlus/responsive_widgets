[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/responsive_widgets.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/responsive_widgets)

This plugin helps to create responsive widgets, that makes auto-size with the **proportion between reference screen size** (width, height and shortest side(dpi))  with the screen that the app is running. The package only changed the original widgets, like "Container" to apply a function that make this calculation.

## Getting Started  

First of all you need to use the code `ResponsiveWidgets.init(context)` to make the plugin works. 
Use `ResponsiveWidgets.builder(child: )`, to recalculate the proportion every time the sizes of device changes. 
Inclusive when the device turned to left/right... The code need to be placed on the first screen of the app, inside of
the build method, like this: [See also in code](https://github.com/LucazzP/responsive_widgets/blob/master/example/lib/home_screen.dart)


    class  _HomeScreenState  extends  State<HomeScreen> {
	    @override
	    Widget  build(BuildContext context) {
	    
		    ResponsiveWidgets.init(context,
			    referenceHeight: 1920, // Optional
			    referenceWidth: 1080, // Optional
			    referenceShortestSide: 411 // Optional,
		    );
		    
		    return  ResponsiveWidgets.builder(
		        child: Scaffold(
                        body: Container()
                    ),
		    );
		}
	}

ShortestSide is basically the dpi of the device, can be got by this code: `MediaQuery.of(context).size.shortestSide;`
Or be changed in the device in Config>Developer Options>Drawing Section>ShortestSide.

### Function to recalculate size responsibly

Have special cases that doesn't have Responsive Widgets created, one of this cases is the Positioned, to solve this problem is simple use this function: `ResponsiveWidgets().getSize(double size)` that will return the correct value to the screen.
