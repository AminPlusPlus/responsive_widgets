/// Typically used for an offset from each of the four sides of a box. For
/// example, the padding inside a box can be represented using this class.
///
/// The [EdgeInsets] class specifies offsets in terms of visual edges, left,
/// top, right, and bottom. These values are not affected by the
/// [TextDirection]. To support both left-to-right and right-to-left layouts,
/// consider using [EdgeInsetsDirectional], which is expressed in terms of
/// _start_, top, _end_, and bottom, where start and end are resolved in terms
/// of a [TextDirection] (typically obtained from the ambient [Directionality]).
///
/// {@tool sample}
///
/// Here are some examples of how to create [EdgeInsets] instances:
///
/// Typical eight-pixel margin on all sides:
///
/// ```dart
/// const EdgeInsets.all(8.0)
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}

///
/// Eight pixel margin above and below, no horizontal margins:
///
/// ```dart
/// const EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 8.0)
